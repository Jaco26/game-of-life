      <h1>Conway's Game Of Life</h1>
      <p>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">The wikipedia</a> article is worth a read. So is <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/remembering-mathematical-magician-john-conway/">this</a>.

      <p>
        The grid on the right is made up of cells that can either be on or off ("alive" or "dead"). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Click any cell to toggle between its two states.
      </p>
      <p>
        Experiment with different configurations of "on" and "off" cells and press play to see it go.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep these rules in mind:
        <ol>
          <li class="about__rule">Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.</li>
          <li class="about__rule">Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.</li>
          <li class="about__rule">Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.</li>
          <li class="about__rule">Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.</li>
        </ol>
